# Diabetes-Prediction
A machine learning model to predict the whether the person has diabetes or not based on some features.
Here I have used the dataset from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/gargmanas/pima-indians-diabetes/tasks.
I have applied the preprocessing techniques like
1. Missing value Imputation
2. Feature Scaling
3. Outlier Handling

Then I have fitted different machine learning models on the dataset and evaluated the models.


# Diabetes_Prediction using Logistic Regression

Here I have used the same dataset as above and have done the same preprocessing steps.
For gettig better accuracy I have done hyperparameter tuning.
